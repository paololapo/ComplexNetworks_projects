# Complex Networks | projects
In this repository, you can find the simulations and analysis done for the final exam of the *Physics of Complex Network: Structure and Dynamics* course in the *Physics of Data* master's program, University of Padova, AY 2023/24. </br>
In particular, you can find the code and the report for three different tasks.

* **SOC model (#15)** </br>
Theoretical characterization and numerical analysis of the *Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile model* for self-organized criticality. This is a well-known mechanism leading to complex behaviors and power-law distributed events. **Score: 0.6.**

* **Axelrod's model for dissemination of culture (#30)** </br>
Simulation of the social influence and consensus formation, describing how local convergence can lead to global polarization. This model from sociophysics exhibits an order-disorder phase transition in cultural diffusion. **Score: 0.5.**

* **Social Connectedness Index (#44)** </br>
The SCI is a measure of the strength of the connection between pairs of geographical regions, based on an anonymized snapshot of active Facebook users. Analysis and comparison of the networks obtained at the country level. **Score: 1.0.**
